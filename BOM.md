## Frame Cut Parts
Good-quality carbon is a must! We recommend Sunlike because they offer ready cuts, and use a great fiber+resin mix (3k plain matte). Email info@sunlikeec.com with a zip of the ['Latest Release of the Carbon Cut Files'][1] for a quote and then use this link to pay after the quote is sent to you: https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dlow8zd. You should select the amount of dollars that were quoted as the quantity of the items since each one is exactly one dollar. **You can also pay by PayPal, so you don't get a big amount in Aliexpress (mainly for Brazilian customers). Ask Sunlike for the instructions in your email**
